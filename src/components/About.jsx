        My Story
        <div className="underline"></div>
      </h2>
      <p>
        I first discovered programming out of pure curiosity — and quickly fell
        in love with it. Since then, I’ve been learning through online courses
        and building personal projects, always driven by a passion for creating
        and problem-solving.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy working on both the frontend and backend. I started with
        JavaScript and React, later expanding into PHP and MySQL. On the
        frontend, I work with CSS, Sass, and Bootstrap, and I'm currently
        deepening my TypeScript skills through real-world projects. I've also
        worked with Git, GitHub, and Docker, explored Firebase, and designed
        interfaces in Figma.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm always ready to learn new skills and technologies, and I enjoy
        taking on challenges that push me to grow — both as a developer and as a
        creative thinker. I'm constantly expanding my knowledge, staying curious
        about new frameworks, tools, and programming concepts, and sharpening my
        skills to build better, smarter solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond coding, I’m passionate about endurance sports like running,
        mountaineering, skiing, and cycling. I love spending time in the
        mountains and being close to nature — always chasing new adventures,
        both outdoors and in my work.
